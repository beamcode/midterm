                <p>Japan's influence over the other countries is growing fast, for example, as time goes on, more and
                    more
                    Japanese restaurants like sushi restaurants open in Europe or America, more mangas are being
                    translated
                    in
                    other languages than japanese and being sold in regular bookstores. <br>
                    All of these factors together make that all members of our group were influenced by japanese culture
                    and, as
                    we had the chance to study abroad, we choose to study in Japan. <br>

                        sushis or
                        ramens, but here, everything is so much tastier and cheaper, it's awesome! And there are far
                        more
                        Japanese specialities than I would have thought (curry, yakitori, yakuniku, melon pan, mochi,

                    <li> <b>IC cards (pasmo, suica, ...):</b> An other handy thing, it acts as your bus ticket but also
                        as
                        little credit card. It's surprising to see in how much stores you can pay with it.</li>
